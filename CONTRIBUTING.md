# Adding a service to the GDPR Tracker database

We use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), so all code changes happen through pull requests
are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

- Fork the repo and create your branch with the name of the service you want to add from `master`.
- Add a file with the service name to the data folder.
- Make sure your data follows the following [schema](https://github.com/privacyradius/gdpr-tracker/blob/master/schema.json). Please look into the following [example](https://github.com/privacyradius/gdpr-tracker/blob/master/example.json) for more info
- If you're unsure about certain data points leave them out our check with the company offering the service.
-  Use [signed commits](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-commits-with-gpg/). We enforce signed commits to verify the identity of contributors.
- Ensure the test suite passes.
- Issue that pull request!
